This is a small full-stack demo project built to practise and understand end-to-end PHP API development using Laravel.

The project implements a RESTful API for managing tasks, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks, with proper request validation and HTTP status handling.

A simple frontend page written in vanilla JavaScript consumes the API using HTTP methods (GET / POST / PATCH / DELETE), demonstrating how frontend interactions trigger backend logic and how API responses drive UI update
